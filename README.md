Tired of sending always the same type of email? Tired of copy pasting mails from Word, Drive, Dropbox and losing styles, layouts and colors?

GMail Template and Snippets Manager allows you to manage a list of predefined templates and insert them directly to your "compose mail" view.

A powerful templating engine is provided so you don't have to replace the fields inside the template manually. Popups are going to ask you what data do you want to insert.

Supports GMail in several languages:
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Deutch
- Catalan
